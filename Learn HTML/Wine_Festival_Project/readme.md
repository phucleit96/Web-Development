# Aguillar Family Wine Festival Website

This project is a simple static website for the Annual Aguillar Family Wine Festival.

## Files

The project consists of two main files:

1. `index.html`: This is the main HTML file that contains the structure of the website. It includes a header with the title of the festival, a table with the schedule of the festival, and a footer with contact information and other details.
2. `style.css`: This is the CSS file that contains the styles for the website. It is linked to the HTML file and applies styles to the elements in the HTML file.
