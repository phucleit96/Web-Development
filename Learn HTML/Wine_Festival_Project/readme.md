This repository contains the HTML and CSS code for a website promoting the Aguillar Family Wine Festival.

Features:

Attractive design with a dark background and white text.
Clear and prominent title "Annual Aguillar Family Wine Festival".
A table displaying the "Wine Festival Schedule" with placeholders for event details.
Contact, Location, and Privacy Policy sections in the footer.
Dependencies:

This website relies on two external stylesheets:
reset.css: This is a common stylesheet that helps normalize browser styles across different platforms. You'll need to obtain this file separately.
style.css: This file contains the styles specific to this website and is included in the repository.
An external font called "Oswald" is used for headings. You can include this font using a service like Google Fonts (https://fonts.google.com/) or by hosting the font files yourself.
Setup:

Download or acquire the reset.css file.
Place both reset.css and style.css in the same directory as the HTML file (index.html).
You can customize the event details in the table body (<tbody>) section of the HTML file.
