# Project Title
Story Form in HTML
## Description

This project is a web application that generates a story based on user input. It consists of several HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

## Files

- `index.html`: This is the main entry point of the application. It contains the form that the user fills out to generate the story.
- `story.html`: This file displays the generated story based on the user's input.
- `original.html`: This file contains the original version of the story.
- `style.css`: This file contains all the styles used across the application.
- `main.js`: This JavaScript file handles the logic for generating the story. It grabs the user's input from the URL, cleans up and capitalizes the input, and then inserts the input into the story.
